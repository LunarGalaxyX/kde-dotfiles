# kde-dotfiles
Dotfiles for my Arch KDE Plasma setup. Themed after the manga Goodnight Punpun.
I use: 
Kitty terminal with zsh.
Dolphin file manager.
And other stuff that you can find in this repo.

Install the dotfiles by running:

# 
```
git clone https://github.com/LunarGalaxyX/kde-dotfiles.git    
```
